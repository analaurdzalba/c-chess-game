# c-chess-game
Created on November 2nd 2018 by Ana Laura Rodr√≠guez Alba
Final project made in C++ to create an interactive chess game for Programming Fundamentals.
This program served as a final submission for my first programming class, although some functions are not optimized the game runs smoothly and allows users to play in turns and decide whether or not to continue with a match.
